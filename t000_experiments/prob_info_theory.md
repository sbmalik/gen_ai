# Learning Pathway:

## Topics
1. Start by reading Chapter 3: Probability and Information Theory in "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al. This chapter provides a solid introduction to probability theory and its applications in deep learning.
2. Basic probability concepts and distributions
3. Maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference
4. Monte Carlo methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI)
5. Information theory, including entropy, KL divergence, and mutual information

### Resources:
* "**Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning**" by Christopher Bishop: This book provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, including probability theory and Bayesian inference. It also covers advanced topics such as Gaussian Processes and variational inference.

* "**Statistical Inference**" by George Casella and Roger Berger: This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical inference, including maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference.

* "**Machine Learning**" by Andrew Ng: This online course provides an excellent introduction to machine learning and covers many of the topics relevant to probability theory and information theory.

* "**Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks**" by David MacKay: This book provides an in-depth introduction to information theory and its applications in machine learning and neural networks.
